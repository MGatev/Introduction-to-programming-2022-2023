# Minesweeper

This is an implementation of the game Minesweeper. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

### Gameplay

1. Choose a gameboard size.
2. Choose how many mines to play with.
3. For each move you want to make, enter a command (open, mark, unmark), followed by the row and column which you want.
4. If you hit a mine, the program prints the board with all the mines revealed in order to know where they were.
5. Here are recommended settings for you:
 - BEGINNER - 4x4 with 4 mines
 - ADVANCED - 7x7 with 14 mines
 - EXPERT - 10x10 with 30 mines
6. The symbols used are:
 - DASH(-) --> if the cell is unrevealed.
 - QUESTION MARK(?) --> if the cell is marked.
 - ASTERIX(*) --> if you hit a mine this symbol appears.

### Winning/Losing

- You win if you reveal all the cells without a mine on them.
- You lose if you hit a mine.
